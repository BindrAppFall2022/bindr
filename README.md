Bindr is a textbook exchnage and messaaging app that will make it easier for Hofstra University students to trade books.
Users will be able to post books that they are willing to sell and buyers will be able to contact them to negotiate.
The application will be written using Flutter for the frontend and Firebase for the backend.
